     //The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming API for HTML and XML documents. 
     //It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.

     //Shadow DOM allows hidden DOM trees to be attached to elements in the regular DOM tree — 
     //this shadow DOM tree starts with a shadow root, underneath which you can attach any element, in the same way as the normal DOM.
